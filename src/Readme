The folder contains four .java files along with this readme file.

Overview
---------------------------------------------------------
When executed, these .java files generates a base synopsis of user given length  
for user provided number of nodes. When TestCount.java is executed the main function
of SGCount.java is executed 16 times providing the user with 16 different base
synopsis values.Same goes with TestSum.java and SGSum.java

Executing the programs
---------------------------------------------------------
In order to run the programs you can directly clone the project into your eclipse 
git repository using the https link of the project in github, and then import it 
into the java repository and run the programs.

Example execution
--------------------
>If the TestCount.java is considered for the execution.
>once you run the program, "Enter number of nodes" is appeared on the console.
>Here you can enter any number of nodes(eg;10000,40000etc).
>once entered another sentence appears saying "Enter Synopsis length".
>Here you can enter the bit length of synopsis as 16,32,64 etc. 
>after this the output is displayed saying "Base Synopsis value:" 
>Below this there is a line displaying the round number as the indication of the 
total number of times the program is executed.
>For 16 times same process is repeated. In order to calculate the average of the 
base synopsis you can write down the 16 base synopsis. 
Same process is followed with TestSum.java.
